# Formidable Elements

You can find one document per component. If the component is not documented, please refer to the original library and pass
parameters through `data-config`.

- [count-down](count-down.md)
- [anchor-ed](anchor-ed.md)

## Api documentation

Or check [the full api documentation](api.md)

## Filesize

You can [check each component size](filesize.md). One of the goal of formidable element is to avoid bloated elements with heavy dependencies.
